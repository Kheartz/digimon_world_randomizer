tech name block begins at 0x14D65494 and ends at 0x14D65BF0

total of 0x75C (1884) bytes

blocks are variable length strings packed in 4-byte alignment

exclusion sections of 0x130 (304) bytes each
    0x14D65828 - 0x14D65958 (inside Spiral Twister)

(while the following is true, the reason is that this is pointered data -- hence the 4-byte align)
pads to 4-byte alignement AFTER null terminator, e.g.
'Meltdown' is 8 characters, but it takes 12 to store it because 'Meltdown\0' is 9 characters and next 4-byte align is 12
'Giga Freeze' is 11 characters, and only takes 12 to store.
list( filter( None, data_packed.split('\0') ) ) should turn a block of tech names into a list of name strings.

this useless shit is pointered all over the place.  Most of it is together but some is scattered (e.g. Bubble and Tremar)


spawnItem has a few weird things because of the centarumon maze:

'Giant Meat' spawns on the map.
'Off. Disk' spawns on the map.
'MP Floppy' spawns on the map.
'sm.recovery' spawns on the map.
'Def. Disk' spawns on the map.
'Meat' spawns on the map.
'Port. potty' spawns on the map.
'Hispeed dsk' spawns on the map.
'med.recovery' spawns on the map.
'Moldy Meat' spawns on the map.
'Orange bana' spawns on the map.
'Happymushrm' spawns on the map.
'Auto Pilot' spawns on the map.
'Omni Disk' spawns on the map.
'Medium MP' spawns on the map.

I think a good solution is to swap food -> food and nonfood -> nonfood (and balance using price)
This should mean we still have weird crap in centarumon but no MP Floppys in native forest (or....
allow that?  but also make centarumon's place weird af somehow?)


Ideas for things to randomize:
  ✓Starters and their starting tech
  ✓Items in chests
  ✓Items given by Tokomon
    Seadramon tech gifts (easy)
  ✓Map items (time consuming)
    Meat farm 5x bonus -> random food (difficult!! string encoding etc)
    Vending machines (difficult, hard-coded text boxes)
    Background music (probably easy, but do I want this?)
    Enemy digimon (difficult, but very high value if done.  Requires a change in 2 places for each.)
  ✓Evolutions (highly requested)
  ----MUST FIX REQS FOR PANJYAMON, GIGADRAMON, METALETEMON!!!
    Learnable techs (most likely not possible, but cool af)
    Random recruitments (just the dudes in town, not who you fight -- Syd investigating)


Replace AS Decoder with save game?
    0x14D66940 is description "You can read Ancient Script\0"
                              "Save the game anywhere!    \0"
    0x14D688A4 is item name.  Technically 20 characters, but in practice only 12.
                              "Game Saver"
                              "Save Floppy"
    need Save function pointer
    need item function pointer table (to insert save function)
