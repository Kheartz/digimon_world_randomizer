# digimon_world_randomizer
Digimon World 1 (PS1) data randomizer.  Create a unique, brand new experience for the classic game!

To use, open settings.ini and adjust all settings according to preference.  In [general], set Input as the relative path to your Digimon World .bin file, then set Output to the filename where you would like the modified .bin file to be placed.

i.e. if your DW binary file is called Digimon World.bin and is in the same folder as digimon_randomize.exe or digimon_randomize.py:
Input = Digimon World.bin
Output = Digimon World Rando.bin

After you have the settings you want, run digimon_randomize.py or digimon_randomize.exe.  The seed used (whether you set it manually or left it blank) will be printed out to the console.
If you are doing a race, have your racing opponent(s) put that seed value in their settings.ini file (and make sure they have the same settings selected!)
